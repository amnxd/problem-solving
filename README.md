# Competitive Programming Solutions

Welcome to my Competitive Programming repository! Here, you'll find my solutions to various problems from Codeforces and other competitive programming platforms. This repository serves as a personal archive of my coding practices and problem-solving techniques.

## About

This repository contains my solutions to problems I've solved on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). The problems vary in difficulty, and I aim to improve my skills through consistent practice and participation in contests. You will find solutions for a range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, and more.

## Languages Used

- C++
- Python

Feel free to explore the code written in these languages!

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
/Codeforces ├── Problem_1 │ ├── solution.cpp │ └── README.md ├── Problem_2 │ ├── solution.py │ └── README.md └── ...


- Each problem is stored in its own folder, named according to the problem title or number.
- The `solution.*` files contain the code for the respective problem.
- Each folder may also contain a `README.md` file with details about the problem, my thought process, and any relevant notes.

## How to Run the Code

To run the solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amnxd/cp-cf.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired problem's folder:
   ```bash
   cd cp-cf/bits
   ```
3. Compile and run the code (for C++):
   ```bash
   g++ solution.cpp -o solution
   ./solution
   ```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Alternatively, you can open an issue to discuss your ideas.
